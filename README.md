# Citi_Bike
**OBJECTIVE**: Use Citi Bike Database to analyze and identify insights that could potentially grow the existing setup, streamline operations and have a positive impact on the revenue for the business.

**OUTCOME**: Post implementation of our PowerBI application, we were able to provide data-backed answers to the following business use cases:
*Average Trip Duration - to help the Business teams to streamline their operations for the allocation of bikes on docking stations. This will eventually maximize the number of trips per bike by reducing the turnaround time per ride.
*Popular Bike Make & Model classified by trip duration - to assist the Business teams in deciding to capitalize more on a particular make and model of the bike by identifying which bikes are more efficient and trustworthy for longer/shorter trip durations, thus ensuring better customer experience
*Average age of the customer riding bike â€“ to help the management identify marketing strategies and whether the bikes need certain age-specific modifications to enhance the ride experience.
